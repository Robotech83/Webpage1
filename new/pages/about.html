    <p>From mechanical roots to robotics innovation — here's my journey.</p>

      <h2>Hi, I'm a Maker and Builder</h2>
      <p>I'm a 42-year-old creator with over a decade of hands-on mechanical experience and a strong passion for
        robotics and embedded systems.</p>

      <p>Over the last <strong>6 years</strong>, I’ve built various robotic systems, integrating hardware and AI to
        bring machines to life. I’ve worked with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Arduino</strong> — 5+ years of circuit design, servo control, and sensor integration</li>
        <li><strong>Raspberry Pi (3 & 4)</strong> — 4 years of scripting, GPIO control, and AI deployment</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanical Repair</strong> — 10 years in the field as a diesel service mechanic</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My current focus is on combining Python, AI, and hardware to create intelligent robotics platforms like my
        humanoid robot, <strong>Sonny</strong>.</p>

      <h3>🌐 My Web Development Journey</h3>
      <p>
        I began learning web development as a way to document and share my robotics work. What started as basic HTML
        quickly grew into a deeper interest in building full-featured websites and interactive apps. Over time, I’ve
        sharpened my skills in <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> by
        building real projects — including this very portfolio site, a functional To-Do List app, and a browser-based
        Tic Tac Toe game.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through trial, error, and persistence, I’ve learned to structure responsive pages with semantic HTML, style them
        cleanly with modern CSS, and add interactivity using JavaScript. I’m still refining my game logic skills and
        experimenting with more advanced UI patterns, but web development has become a creative outlet that complements
        my robotics expertise.
