      <h2>Hi, I'm a Maker and Builder</h2>
      <p>I'm a 42-year-old creator with over a decade of hands-on mechanical experience and a strong passion for robotics and embedded systems.</p>

      <p>Over the last <strong>6 years</strong>, I’ve built various robotic systems, integrating hardware and AI to bring machines to life. I’ve worked with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Arduino</strong> — 5+ years of circuit design, servo control, and sensor integration</li>
        <li><strong>Raspberry Pi (3 & 4)</strong> — 4 years of scripting, GPIO control, and AI deployment</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanical Repair</strong> — 10 years in the field as a diesel service mechanic</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My current focus is on combining Python, AI, and hardware to create intelligent robotics platforms like my humanoid robot, <strong>Sonny</strong>.</p>
