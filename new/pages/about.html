      <h2>Hi, I'm a Maker and Builder</h2>
      <p>I'm a 42-year-old creator with over a decade of hands-on mechanical experience and a strong passion for
        robotics and embedded systems.</p>

      <p>Over the last <strong>6 years</strong>, I‚Äôve built various robotic systems, integrating hardware and AI to
        bring machines to life. I‚Äôve worked with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Arduino</strong> ‚Äî 5+ years of circuit design, servo control, and sensor integration</li>
        <li><strong>Raspberry Pi (3 & 4)</strong> ‚Äî 4 years of scripting, GPIO control, and AI deployment</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanical Repair</strong> ‚Äî 10+ years in the field as a diesel service mechanic</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My current focus is on combining Python, AI, and hardware to create intelligent robotics platforms like my
        humanoid robot, <strong>Sonny</strong>.</p>

        <h2>üåê My Web Development Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I‚Äôve always been fascinated by how the web works, and I wanted to create a platform to showcase my projects
          and
          connect with others in the maker community. I started with simple HTML pages and CSS stylesheets, but as I
          learned more about web technologies, I realized the potential of building dynamic, interactive applications.
          I dove into the world of <strong>JavaScript</strong>, exploring its capabilities and learning how to
          manipulate
          the DOM to create engaging user experiences.</p>
        <p>
          Through trial, error, and persistence, I‚Äôve learned to structure responsive pages with semantic HTML, style
          them
          cleanly with modern CSS, and add interactivity using JavaScript. I‚Äôm still refining my game logic skills and
          experimenting with more advanced UI patterns, but web development has become a creative outlet that
          complements
          my robotics expertise.
        </p>

      <h2>üïπÔ∏è My Game Development Background</h2>
      <p>
        For the past two years, I‚Äôve been exploring game development ‚Äî combining creativity, logic, and design into
        interactive experiences. While I‚Äôm still expanding my skills, I‚Äôve found my strengths in building clean and
        responsive <strong>Menu UI systems</strong>, managing complex flows with <strong>Scene Managers</strong>, and
        creating robust <strong>State Machines</strong> to handle game logic and transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether I‚Äôm working on browser-based games or planning larger projects, I focus on structuring code that‚Äôs
        modular, readable, and easy to expand. Game development has become an exciting extension of my engineering
        mindset, allowing me to experiment with interactivity, feedback systems, and the joy of player-driven outcomes.
